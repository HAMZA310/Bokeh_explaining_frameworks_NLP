<ul>
  <li>Parse the text from the body of each document using Natural Language Processing (NLP). </li>
  <li>Turn each document instance di into a feature vector Xi using Term Frequencyâ€“inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF).</li>
  <li>Apply Dimensionality Reduction to each feature vector Xi using t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) to cluster similar research articles in the two dimensional plane X embedding Y1.</li>
  <li>Use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to project down the dimensions of X to a number of dimensions that will keep .95 variance while removing noise and outliers in embedding Y2.</li>
  <li>Apply k-means clustering on Y2, where k is 20, to label each cluster on Y1.</li>
  <li>Apply Topic Modeling on X using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to discover keywords from each cluster.</li>
  <li>Investigate the clusters visually on the plot, zooming down to specific articles as needed, and via classification using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).</li>  
</ul> 
<p>Total of <b>32,651 samples</b> analysed. Articles that are not English dropped.</p1>""")
